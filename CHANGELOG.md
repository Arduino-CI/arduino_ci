- Support for all builtin Bits and Bytes functions https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/
- Support for GODMODE and time functions

- Mocks for `random` functions with seed control
- Many original Arduino `#define`s
- Mocks for pinMode, analog/digital read/write
- Support for WString
- Support for Print

- All the IO stuff (pins, serial port support flags, etc) from the Arduino library
- Support for Serial (backed by GODMODE)

### Changed
- Made `wget` have quieter output

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security


## [0.1.3] - 2018-01-25
### Added
- C++ functions for `assure`; `assert`s will run tests and continue, `assure`s will abort on failures
- Missing dotfiles in the `DoSomething` project have been committed

### Changed
- `arduino_ci_remote.rb` doesn't attempt to set URLs if nothing needs to be downloaded
- `arduino_ci_remote.rb` does unit tests first
- `unittest_main()` is now the macro for the `int main()` of test files

### Fixed
- All test files were reporting "not ok" in TAP output.  Now they are OK iff all asserts pass.
- Directories with a C++ extension in their name could cause problems.  Now they are ignored.
- `CppLibrary` had trouble with symlinks. It shoudn't anymore.
- `CppLibrary` had trouble with vendor bundles.  It might in the future, but I have a better fix ready to go if it's an issue.


## [0.1.2] - 2018-01-25

- `DisplayManager` class for managing Xvfb instance if needed
- `ArduinoCmd` captures and caches preferences
- `ArduinoCmd` reports on whether a board is installed
- `ArduinoCmd` sets preferences
- `ArduinoCmd` installs boards
- `ArduinoCmd` installs libraries
- `ArduinoCmd` selects boards (compiler preference)
- `ArduinoCmd` verifies sketches
- `CppLibrary` manages GCC for unittests
- `CIConfig` manages overridable config for all testing

### Changed
