# ArduinoCI Ruby gem (`arduino_ci`) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/arduino_ci.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/arduino_ci) [![Documentation](http://img.shields.io/badge/docs-rdoc.info-blue.svg)](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/arduino_ci/0.1.18)

You want to run tests on your Arduino library (bonus: without hardware present), but the IDE doesn't support that.  Arduino CI provides that ability.

You want to precisely replicate certain software states in your library, but you don't have sub-millisecond reflexes for physically faking the inputs, outputs, and serial port.   Arduino CI fakes 100% of the physical input and output of an Arduino board, including the clock.

You want your Arduino library to be automatically built and tested every time someone contributes code to your project on GitHub, but the Arduino IDE lacks the ability to run unit tests. [Arduino CI](https://github.com/ianfixes/arduino_ci) provides that ability.

`arduino_ci` is a cross-platform build/test system, consisting of a Ruby gem and a series of C++ mocks.  It enables tests to be run both locally and as part of a CI service like Travis or Appveyor.  Any OS that can run the Arduino IDE can run `arduino_ci`.

## Quick Start

For a bare-bones example that you can copy from, see [SampleProjects/DoSomething](SampleProjects/DoSomething).

The complete set of C++ unit tests for the `arduino_ci` library itself are in the [SampleProjects/TestSomething](SampleProjects/TestSomething) project.  The [test files](SampleProjects/TestSomething/test/) are named after the type of feature being tested.


### You Need Ruby and Bundler

You'll need Ruby version 2.2 or higher, and to `gem install bundler` if it's not already there.


### You Need A Compiler (`g++`)

For unit testing, you will need a compiler; [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is preferred.

* **Linux**: `gcc`/`g++` is likely pre-installed.
* **OSX**: `g++` is an alias for `clang`, which is provided by Xcode and the developer tools.  You are free to `brew install gcc` as well; this is also tested and working.
* **Windows**: you will need Cygwin, and the `mingw-gcc-g++` package.  A full set of (working) install instructions can be found in `appveyor.yml`, as this is how CI runs for this project.


### Changes to Your Repo

Add a file called `Gemfile` (no extension) to your Arduino project:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'arduino_ci'
```

It would also make sense to add the following to your `.gitignore`, or copy [the `.gitignore` used by this project](.gitignore):

```
/.bundle/
/.yardoc
Gemfile.lock
/_yardoc/
/coverage/
/doc/
/pkg/
/spec/reports/
vendor
*.gem

# rspec failure tracking
.rspec_status

# C++ stuff
*.bin
*.bin.dSYM
```


### Installing the Dependencies

Fulfilling the `arduino_ci` library dependency is as easy as running this command:

```
$ bundle install
```


### Running tests

With that installed, just the following shell command each time you want the tests to execute:

```
$ bundle exec arduino_ci_remote.rb
```

`arduino_ci_remote.rb` is the main entry point for this library.  This command will iterate over all the library's `examples/` and attempt to compile them.  If you set up unit tests, it will run those as well.


### Reference

For more information on the usage of `arduino_ci_remote.rb`, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).  It contains information such as:

* How to configure build options (platforms to test, Arduino library dependencies to install) with an `.arduino-ci.yml` file
* Where to put unit test files
* How to structure unit test files
* How to control the global (physical) state of the Arduino board
* How to modify the Arduino platforms, compilers, test plans, etc


## Setting up Pull Request Testing and/or External CI

The following prerequisites must be fulfilled:

* A GitHub (or other repository-hosting) project for your library
* A CI system like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) that is linked to your project


### Testing with remote CI

> **Note:** `arduino_ci_remote.rb` expects to be run from the root directory of your Arduino project library.


#### Travis CI

You'll need to go to https://travis-ci.org/profile/ and enable testing for your Arduino project.  Once that happens, you should be all set.  The script will test all example projects of the library and all unit tests.

Next, you need this in `.travis.yml` in your repo

```yaml
sudo: false
language: ruby
script:
  - bundle install
  - bundle exec arduino_ci_remote.rb
```


#### Appveyor CI

You'll need to go to https://ci.appveyor.com/projects and add your project.

Next, you'll need this in `appveyor.yml` in your repo.

```yaml
build: off
test_script:
  - bundle install
  - bundle exec arduino_ci_remote.rb
```

## Known Problems

* The Arduino library is not fully mocked.
* I don't have preprocessor defines for all the Arduino board flavors
* https://github.com/ianfixes/arduino_ci/issues
