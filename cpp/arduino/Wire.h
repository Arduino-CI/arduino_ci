/*
 * The Wire Library (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire)
 * allows you to communicate with I2C/TWI devices. The general
 * TWI protocol supports one "master" device and many "slave"
 * devices that share the same two wires (SDA and SCL for data
 * and clock respectively).
 *
 * You initialize the library by calling begin() as a master or
 * begin(myAddress) as a slave (with an int from 8-127). In the
 * initial mock implementation we support only the master role.
 *
 * To send bytes from a master to a slave, start with
 * beginTransmission(slaveAddress), then use write(byte) to
 * enqueue data, and finish with endTransmission().
 *
 * When a master wants to read, it starts with a call to
 * requestFrom(slaveAddress, quantity) which blocks until the
 * request finishes. The return value is either 0 (if the slave
 * does not respond) or the number of bytes requested (which
 * might be more than the number sent since reading is simply
 * looking at a pin value at each clock tick).
 *
 * A master can write to or read from two or more slaves in
 * quick succession (say, during one loop() function), so our
 * mock needs to support preloading data to be read from multiple
 * slaves and archive data sent to multiple slaves.
 *
 * In the mock, this is handled by having an array of wireData_t
 * structures, each of which contains a deque for input and a
 * deque for output. You can preload data to be read and you can
 * look at a log of data that has been written.
