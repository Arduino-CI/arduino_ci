Arduino Sample Projects
=======================

This directory contains projects that are meant to be built with and tested by this gem. Although this directory is named `SampleProjects`, it is by no means optional. These project test the testing framework itself, but also provide examples of how you might write your own tests (which should be placed in the `Projects` directory to avoid being included in the `arduino_ci` project). 

* "DoSomething" is a simple test of the testing framework (arduino_ci) itself to verfy that passes and failures are properly identified and reported.
* "TestSomething" contains tests for all the mock features of arduino_ci.
