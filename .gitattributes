# Configure this repository to use Git's type detection algorithm to guess 
# whether a file is text or binary. Text files will have line endings converted 
# as if you had set 
#   eol=native
# That is, on Windows text files will have CRLF line endings in your working
# directory while on Linux and macOS your text files will have LF line endings
# in your working directory. In either case, they will have LF line endings in
# the Git repository itself.

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout. Git would likely get these right, but
# we can be sure by adding them here.
