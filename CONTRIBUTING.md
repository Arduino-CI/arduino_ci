# Contributing to the ArduinoCI gem

ArduinoCI uses a very standard GitHub workflow.

1. Fork the repository on github
2. Make your desired changes on top of the latest `master` branch, document them in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
3. Push to your personal fork
4. Open a pull request
    * If you are submitting code, use `master` as the base branch
    * If you are submitting broken unit tests (illustrating a bug that should be fixed), use `tdd` as the base branch.

Pull requests will trigger a Travis CI job.  The following two commands will be expected to pass (so you may want to run them locally before opening the pull request):

 * `bundle exec rubocop -D .` - code style tests
 * `bundle exec rspec` - functional tests

 If you do not already have a working ruby development environment set up, run the following commands:

```shell
apt-get install ruby ruby-dev    # For Debian/Ubuntu
dnf install ruby ruby-devel      # For Fedora
yum install ruby ruby-devel      # For Centos/RHEL
gem install bundler
```

Be prepared to write tests to accompany any code you would like to see merged.
See `SampleProjects/TestSomething/test/*.cpp` for the existing tests (run by rspec).


## Convenience Features

To speed up testing by targeting only the files you're working on, you can set several environment variables that `bundle exec rspec` will respond to:

* `ARDUINO_CI_SKIP_SPLASH_SCREEN_RSPEC_TESTS`: if set, this will avoid any rspec test that calls the arduino executable (and as such, causes the splash screen to pop up).
* `ARDUINO_CI_SKIP_RUBY_RSPEC_TESTS`: if set, this will skip all tests against ruby code (useful if you are not changing Ruby code).
* `ARDUINO_CI_SKIP_CPP_RSPEC_TESTS`: if set, this will skip all tests against the `TestSomething` sample project (useful if you are not changing C++ code).
* `ARDUINO_CI_SELECT_CPP_TESTS=<glob>`: if set, this will skip all C++ unit tests whose filenames don't match the provided glob (executed in the tests directory)

Example usage:

```shell
ARDUINO_CI_SKIP_RUBY_RSPEC_TESTS=1 bundle exec rspec
```


## Packaging the Gem

* Merge pull request with new features
* Execute `release-new-version.sh` with the appropriate argument (e.g. `--increment-patch`), which does the following:
    * `git stash save` (at least before the gem build step, but easiest here).
    * `git pull --rebase`
    * Update the sections of `CHANGELOG.md` by running `bundle exec keepachangelog_manager.rb --increment-patch`
    * Bump the version in lib/arduino_ci/version.rb and change it in README.md (since rubydoc.info doesn't always redirect to the latest version)
    * `git add README.md CHANGELOG.md lib/arduino_ci/version.rb`
    * `git commit -m "vVERSION bump"`
    * `git tag -a vVERSION -m "Released version VERSION"`
    * `gem build arduino_ci.gemspec`
    * `git stash pop`
    * `gem push arduino_ci-VERSION.gem`
    * `git push upstream`
    * `git push upstream --tags`
* Visit http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/arduino_ci/VERSION to initiate the doc generation process
